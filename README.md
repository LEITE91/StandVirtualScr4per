# StandVirtualScr4per

StandVirtualScr4per was a fun and educational project developed as part of my Cybersecurity class. Please note that this project was solely intended for educational purposes and not for any commercial or malicious activities.

# Overview
StandVirtualScr4per allows you to scrape data from the "StandVirtual" website. The tool captures various information about vehicles listed on the website and saves it into a convenient CSV file. The scraped information includes:

  Vehicle URL
  Vehicle Name
  Type of Fuel
  Mileage (in kilometers)
  Year of Manufacture
  Price
  Seller's Phone Number
  
# Features

  Easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI): The tool comes with a sleek GUI that provides a user-friendly experience.
  Web Scraping: Utilizing the power of the BeautifulSoup library, StandVirtualScr4per navigates the website's HTML code to extract relevant data.
  Tor Integration: For an added layer of privacy and anonymity, StandVirtualScr4per uses the Tor Browser to switch IP addresses (New Identity) with each request.
  Data Export: The scraped data is saved in a CSV file, making it easy to analyze and manipulate with other tools.

# How to Use

  1- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

  4- Run standvirtual.py
  5- The GUI will appear, allowing you to interact with the scraper.
